/**
 * The Smriti mark: one endless knot, drawn as a single hand-authored stroke
 * repeated at 0°/90°/180°/270°.
 *
 * `LOGOMARK_PATH` is lifted verbatim from the approved brand artwork. Do not
 * re-derive it from the PNGs, do not "clean it up", and do not round the
 * numbers — the arc sweep and the two straight tails are what make the four
 * copies interlock into a closed knot rather than four separate loops.
 *
 * This component is the single source of truth for the mark. The nav, the
 * footer, the loading states, the favicon and `<LogoReveal />` all render from
 * here; nothing in the app renders the logo from a raster image. The PNGs in
 * `/brand` exist for favicon and OG-image generation and for places that
 * cannot take SVG at all, such as email.
