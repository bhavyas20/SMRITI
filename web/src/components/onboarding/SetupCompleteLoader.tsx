/**
 * The full-screen transition shown once the Create Patient wizard is finished,
 * while the new profile's content syncs, before the caregiver lands on the
 * dashboard (frontend.md §16 step 3).
 *
 * ── How it reproduces the reference film ──────────────────────────────────
 * `/brand/setup-loading-reference.mp4` runs one mechanic from start to finish:
 * a line drawing of the scene appears left to right, a warm gold light band
 * follows a beat behind it, and everything the band has passed is left in full
 * colour. Underneath, a hairline progress bar fills in the same gold, and the
 * letters of LOADING darken as the fill passes them.
 *
 * All four of those are driven here by a **single** normalised value, exactly
 * as the film does — which is what keeps the drawing head, the colour wash,
 * the bar and the label locked together instead of four animations that happen
 * to be the same length. That single value is also what lets real progress
 * drive the whole sequence: pass `progress` and the scene draws at the speed
 * the upload actually goes.
 *
 * It is SVG rather than the video itself so it stays crisp at any size, costs
 * a few kB instead of 1.3 MB, and can be driven by real async progress.
 *
 * The scene's geometry lives in `SkylineArtwork.tsx`; see the note at the top
 * of that file about the artwork being a redraw rather than a trace.
