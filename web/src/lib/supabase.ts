/**
 * Supabase client initialisation. Nothing else.
 *
 * ── Where the real keys go ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `web/.env.local` (git-ignored), two lines:
 *
 *     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
 *     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<the anon / publishable key>
 *
 * The **anon** key only. The service-role key must never appear anywhere under
 * `web/` — it bypasses RLS, and RLS is the entire authorization layer for this
 * product (AGENTS.md non-negotiable 8).
 *
 * If either variable is missing the app does not crash: it drops into mock
 * mode (`isMockMode` below) and `lib/db.ts` answers every query from typed
 * fixtures instead. That keeps the UI demoable on a fresh clone, and it is the
 * only sanctioned reason for a query in this app not to hit the server.
 *
 * This file and `lib/db.ts` are the only two modules in `web/src` permitted to
 * import `@supabase/supabase-js` (frontend.md §1, §15 rule 1).
