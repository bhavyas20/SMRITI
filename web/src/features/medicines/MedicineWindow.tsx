/**
 * The medicine window and the chosen time.
 *
 * The server enforces `window_start_min ≤ chosen_time_min ≤ window_end_min`
 * with a check constraint. frontend.md §8 is explicit that the UI must make
 * that constraint **structurally unreachable** rather than lean on the database
 * to reject it — a caregiver who submits an invalid time and is handed a raw
 * Postgres constraint violation has learned nothing about what they did wrong.
 *
 * Two things make it unreachable here:
 *
 *   1. The chosen-time slider's own `min` and `max` **are** the window bounds.
 *      There is no position on it that lies outside the window; the invalid
 *      state cannot be expressed, not merely rejected.
 *   2. Dragging the window carries the chosen time with it. Narrowing a window
 *      past the chosen time clamps it to the new edge rather than leaving an
 *      invalid pair behind.
 *
 * ── One limitation, stated plainly ────────────────────────────────────────
 * A window that crosses midnight (start 22:00, end 02:00) cannot be expressed
 * on this control, and this form will not produce one. The schema stores
 * minutes with modulo-1440 arithmetic, so the *database* would accept it, but
 * the check constraint as written (`chosen between start and end`) would not.
 * A genuine overnight window needs a server-side decision first; a night-time
 * dose inside one day is fully supported.
