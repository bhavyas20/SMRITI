/**
 * Chart colour and geometry.
 *
 * ── Why these are not simply the brand colours ────────────────────────────
 * Smriti's palette is warm and deliberately low-chroma: terracotta, gold,
 * coral, a muted olive sage. That is right for a calm product surface and
 * *wrong* as a categorical data palette — run those five hex values through a
 * colour-vision check against the ivory chart surface and they fail four ways:
 * gold sits outside the usable lightness band, sage is chromatic enough to read
 * as grey, and coral↔gold are only ΔE 11 apart to a reader with normal colour
 * vision, let alone a protanope, where sage↔terracotta collapse to ΔE 4.
 *
 * Two decisions follow, and they are the reason the charts in this app are
 * legible:
 *
 * **1. Almost nothing here is categorical.** Where five things needed
 * comparing — the cognitive domains — they became five small multiples rather
 * than five lines in five colours. That is a better chart anyway, and it means
 * the app never needs a five-hue palette it cannot make safe.
 *
 * **2. The one multi-colour encoding is a status palette, not a series
 * palette.** Medicine outcomes are not arbitrary categories; they are good,
 * middling and bad. `STATUS` below is the validated trio — every check passes
 * against the ivory surface, with the worst adjacent pair at ΔE 8.1 under
 * protanopia. Because that clears the floor rather than the target, these are
 * always shipped with the secondary encoding that makes them safe regardless:
 * a legend, direct labels, and a 2px surface gap between stacked segments.
 *
 * Status colours are reserved. They never stand in for "series 3".
