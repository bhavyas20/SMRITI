/**
 * How a flag is described to a caregiver.
 *
 * The database calls these `engagement_drop` and `adherence_drop`. A worried
 * adult child needs a sentence, not a column value — and, crucially, a sentence
 * that does not diagnose. Smriti detects a *change in a pattern*; it does not
 * know why, and saying otherwise to someone frightened about their parent would
 * be both wrong and cruel. Every line below describes what changed and points
 * at the evidence.
