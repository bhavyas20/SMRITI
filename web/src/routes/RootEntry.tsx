 * What `/` is.
 *
 * frontend.md §2 defines `/` as the adaptive patient-count redirect; the
 * marketing site also has to live at the root, because that is the URL people
 * are given. Both are true at once and the session decides which: signed out
 * you get the pitch, signed in you get taken to your patient. A signed-in
 * caregiver never has to walk past a marketing page to reach their mother's
 * medicines, and a visitor never sees a redirect loop.
 *
 * The §4 redirect logic itself is not duplicated here — it stays in exactly one
 * place, `RootRedirect`, which this delegates to.
