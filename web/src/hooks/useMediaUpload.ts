/**
 * Uploading a photo or a voice clip (frontend.md §13).
 *
 * Two rules, both of which have a failure behind them:
 *
 * **Compress before upload.** Whatever lands in the bucket has to come back
 * down to a tablet in a house on a slow connection. A 4 MB phone photo of a
 * grandchild is a minute of someone's day and a chunk of their data plan; at
 * 200 kB and 800 px it is indistinguishable on a 10-inch screen.
 *
 * **Confirm the upload, then write the row.** The tablet's content puller
 * downloads every referenced path and aborts the *entire* pull if one 404s. A
 * `people` row pointing at an upload that never finished does not degrade
 * gracefully into a missing photo — it stops the patient's tablet from getting
 * any content update at all. So `uploadPatientMedia` resolves only once the
 * object is committed, and callers write the row afterwards, never in parallel.
 *
 * The returned value is a **path**, not a URL. Signed URLs expire; the tablet
 * resolves paths with its own credentials.
