 * The scroll-triggered entrance used by every section below the hero.

 * The reference landing page animated the hero and then nothing else, which is
 * why it went flat the moment you scrolled — the page had already spent its
 * only trick. Giving each section its own arrival keeps the page alive all the
 * way down without any single moment being loud.
 *
 * `once: true` matters: a card that re-animates every time it scrolls back into
 * view is a page that will not settle, and on a long page that is genuinely
