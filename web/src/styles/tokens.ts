/**
 * Smriti brand tokens — the single source of truth for colour and type.
 *
 * These values are mirrored into CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`
 * (inside Tailwind v4's `@theme` block) so that they are reachable three ways:
 *
 *   - Tailwind utility classes  →  `bg-terracotta`, `text-ink`, `border-sand`
 *   - CSS custom properties     →  `var(--color-terracotta)`
 *   - TypeScript                →  `tokens.color.terracotta`
 *
 * Reach for a utility class first, the CSS variable second, and this module
 * only where a value has to cross into JavaScript — SVG `stroke` attributes,
 * Recharts series colours, Framer Motion `animate` targets. Raw hex literals
 * do not belong in components; if a colour is missing, add it here and to the
 * `@theme` block in the same change.
