/**
 * Care guide (frontend.md §8).
 *
 * Static content, no backend wiring — deliberately hardcoded rather than pulled
 * from a CMS, because it is short, it changes rarely, and a caregiver reading it
 * at midnight should not be waiting on a network request.
 *
 * The one editorial rule this page follows: **nothing here diagnoses anything.**
 * Smriti detects changes in patterns. It does not know why a pattern changed and
 * neither does this page, and telling a frightened adult child otherwise would
 * be both wrong and unkind.

      'Open the flag and read the evidence. It shows when the change appears to start, which areas are involved, and how many sessions it is based on. A flag from four sessions is a much weaker signal than one from thirty.',
      'Before assuming anything, check the ordinary explanations: has she been unwell, has a medicine changed, has someone been staying, has the tablet moved to a room she does not sit in.',

      'The window matters as much as the chime. A wide window means she can take it when she gets to it and still have it count; a narrow one produces missed doses that were not really missed.',
